- 👋 Hi, I’m @ApolloCarthage

## A little bit about myself:

- 🏫 I am a computer science student studying at Illinois State University
- 🌱 I am always interested in learning and growing my skills both in the world of technology and in any other subject!
- 😄 My hobbies include: Coding (duh), playing guitar, hiking, reading, writing, studying language, playing chess, and just about anything else under the sun

## Technology interests

The main areas of tech i'm interested in collaborating on are
- Artificial Integlligence
- Quantum Computing
- Cyber Security
- Building more efficient algorithms and data structures
- and, of course, video games (but I mean that applies to around 99.9% of the people here doesn't it?)
